# Phishing mails simulation

Hello Bob,

I found your email on the Bull Terrier forum, and you had some great posts about our adorable little puppies. I recommend this forum, which is really one of the biggest and super professional, where you can meet true enthusiasts. It was suggested to me by a veterinarian.

Best regards,
John
